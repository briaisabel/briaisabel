Hi ![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18350557/176309783-0785949b-9127-417c-8b55-ab5a4333674e.gif)My name is Bria Lang 

Executive Quality Assurance Analyst and Computer Information Systems Grauate 

I am a self-motivated professional skilled in cybersecurity, leadership, data analysis, and quality auditing. I value helping developing entities operate intentionally and efficiently by sharing opportunities that spread knowledge, instill confidence, and inspire a culture of service. I am collaborative, hardworking, adaptable, and efficient in prioritizing simultaneous tasks to optimize operations in alignment with organization objectives. I recently completed a six-month IT program for military spouses at Weber State University called The Rosie Project where I obtained my CompTIA Security+ certification. In addition to this, I also completed my Google Cybersecurity certificate. I studied Computer Information Systems at Southern New Hampshire University where I graduated Summa Cum Laude. I aspire to break into the technology sector so I may apply and strengthen this knowledge!
